# Diamond Wedge Airfoil Calculator
Program to calculate and plot pressure coefficients, pressure values and drag/lift coefficients over a symmetric double wedge airfoils at different angle of attacks and freestream Mach numbers.

Assumptions: Inviscid, steady, compressible two dimensional flow for a calorically perfect gas. Airfoil is symmetric with a constant wedge angle.

Regions are given as below:
